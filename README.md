 Arduino uno
 L293D driver
 4 DC motor
 Ultrasonic sensor
 IR emitter
 LED
Working:

All these motors run in a normal way as we programmed.
When a person close his eyes for 5 seconds,the IR sensor will detect it and send the signal to controller.
The controller now stop all the operations performed by the motor.
The warning lights will start blinking.
Once the person is completely awake,he should acknowledge to ultrasonic sensor physically.
Then the system starts to run normally.



NOTE:

The arduino  uno is placed under L293D Driver shield
